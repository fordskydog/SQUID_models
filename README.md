# SQUID_models

numerical models of RSC SQUID, noisy RSJ, noisy RSJ SQUID, noisy RCSJ SQUID

Written by Patrick Ford for Martin Huber, Ph.D., Superconducting Electronics and Low Temperature Physics Lab University of Colorado Denver, Department of Physics

This repository contains the four numerical models mentioned above in python 3.

Each model has two associated notebooks and one python file:
- a dev_notebook that captures the process of building the methods and utilities for each model.
- a revised notebook explaning the models and the utilities more throughly.
- a pure python file for implementing the models and utilities.

Also included is a tutorial notebook that walks through using the model and all the utilities in one package.
